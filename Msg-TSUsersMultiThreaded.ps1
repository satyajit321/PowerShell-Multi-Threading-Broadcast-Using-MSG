   Msg-TSUsersMultiThreaded.ps1
.EXAMPLE
Use notepad to list each server in a new line
Serverlist.txt - Put it in the same location as the PS Script.

#With KeepErrors = $True

Error 1722 getting session names
PS system32>
------------------------

.EXAMPLE

A common log is visible on the progress, but it doesn't state if the msg.exe call was success or failure

 msg.exe *  /server:localhost 'Server will be down at 1PM today'
Executing: 'Server: localhost1'
